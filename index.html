    <h1><p class="second-paragraph">Unreal Engine for Fortnite!</p></h1>
    <p class="first-paragraph">This is the webpage of scholar and programmer Luck Berlus.</p>
    <p class="second-paragraph">I have used the Unreal Engine for Fortnite for three days to work on game design.<br>The island project, for the most part, was supposed to be a running game with speed-based gameplay. However, due to poor level design, difficulty with editing, and the huge software, I am afraid to say the game is an unfinished mess that mostly went nowhere in terms of playability. Regardless, I have still chosen to show the game off as my first project.</p>
    
    <p class="first-paragraph">Description</p>
    <br>
    <p class="third-paragraph">- What was your design process, including inspirations?</p><br>
    <p class="second-paragraph">My main inspiration was Sonic the Hedgehog because he is one of my most favorite gaming franchises and one of the most iconic franchises of all time. Sonic is known for his boost (building up speed) gameplay and platforming, which is to adapt to faster speeds.</p><br>
    <p class="third-paragraph">- What were some challenges that you faced and how did you overcome these?</p><br>
    <p class="second-paragraph">A lot of challenges. First, the game level was hard to adapt to the Sonic long gameplay with the overall stage resembling nothing to what you see in his games: the character's momentum doesn't inherently build up on its own (when you have to edit on a 3D model software that was built for battle royale games like Fortnite or Fall Guys), although Sonic's platforming uses ramps that increase the player's speed. What was really the problem was the ramps were hard to implement across the ground due to my confusion with the function of the platforming. The overall process took a lot of time due to errors and tons of tweaks that took up time and space. The process was mostly rushed by the switch to a big computer and the software not being ready to handle the software storage.</p><br>
    <p class="third-paragraph">- What was your target audience?</p><br>
    <p class="second-paragraph">My classmates. Although more broadly, it's a game for teenagers. Adults would hate the design and kids would find it too difficult to complete.</p><br>
    <p class="third-paragraph">- What would you do differently next time?</p><br>
    <p class="second-paragraph">Next time, I would have the game design thought out more thoroughly to meet the deadline sooner instead of having to borrow more time rushing the overall project. I should've added more props and spent my time better finishing the gameplay as there was so much to be desired.</p>
